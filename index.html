      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>I am a graduate of Pwani University having undertaken a barchelors degree in Environmental Planning and Management. Before i joined Moringa i was helping out in some startup company in Eldoret as a social media strategist.
        Was referred to Moringa School by a friend of mine who saw it wise for me to learn how to code so i could integrate it with my other skills. Moringa is the best school to learn programming as it offers an integrated environment both in learning how to code and social skills which are fundamentals in job world.</p>
        <p>I love to learn new concepts and interact with new people. I play basketball as a hobby and for fun. It also helps me exercise.</p>
